1.Features of VPC PEERING(ATLEAST 10)(->cannot share nat but we can share bashion host)
2.WHAT IS VPN.WHAT ARE THE COMPONENTS OF VPN.
3.WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN VPN AND DIRECT CONNECT.
4.WHAT ARE THE USE CASE OF VPN AND DIRECT CONNECT.
5.WHEN DO YOU USE DIRECT CONNECT INSTTEAD OF VPN.
6.HOW MANY TYPES OF LOAD BALANCER ARE THERE.
7.WHAT ARE THE FEATURES OF APPLICATION LOAD BALANCER(SUPPORTS SNI(WHICH USE IN LOAD BALANCER TO USE EXITING CERTIFICATES,supports dynamic port mapping through containers.
8.FEATURES OF NETWORK LOAD BALANCER.(SERVE YOU MILLIONS OF REQUEST PER SECOND,WE CAN SETUP FIXED IP ADDRESS,PROXY PROTOCOL)
9.WHAT IS PROXY PROTOCOL.
10.WHAT IS X-FORWARDED FOR.
11.WHAT IS STICKY SESSION.
12.WHAT IS SSL TERMINATION AND SSL OFFLOADING.

PLACEMENT GROUP(WHEN WE WANT HIGH BANDWIDTH AND LOW LATENCY WE GO FOR PLACEMENT GROUP)
->NOT ALL INSTANCE SUPPORT PLACEMENT GROUP.(NEED ATLEAST 10GB SIZE.)
 
->ACCESS LOG IS PRESENT IN S3.

bashion host entry point is nat address.only from nat address one can login in bashion host.

VPN:
->It GOES THROUGH INTERNET THROUGH ENCRYPTED WAY.WHERE BANDWIDTH IS NOT FIXED.IT CAN BE SETUP EASILY.IT IS CHEAPER(COST EFFECTIVE)

VPN COMPONENTS:
->ROUTER-CLIENT SIDE(VPG/VGW ->VIRTUAL PRIVATE GATEWAY)


DIRECT CONNECT:
->IT GIVES YOU DEDICATED BANDWIDTH.IN DIRECT CONNECT WE CANNOT ENCRYPT DATA.BUT WE CAN PROVIDE THE DATA ENCRYPTION EXTERNALLY.SETUP IS TIME CONSUMING.

VPN CLOUDHUB:
->WHERE WE CONNECT ALL THE BRANCHES WITH CLOUD THROUGH VGW.

ENDPOINTS:
->INTERFACE ENDPOINTS(IF WE WANT TO CONNECT MY VPC WITH SOME SERVICE LIKE SNS,SQS WE GO FOR INTERFACE ENDPOINTS)
->GATEWAY ENDPOINTS(IT SUPPORTS ONLY S3 AND DYANOMO DB)

->CLOUDWATCH CAN CAPTURES THE LOG(WE HAVE TO INSTALL AGENTS AND CONFIGURE THEM SO THAT IT CAN SEND LOGS).

->XFF(USED TO FIND THE IP OF CLIENT) IS SUPPORTED BY ELB AND PROXY PROTOCOL IS SUPPORTED BY NLB AND CLB.

**HOW TO CHANGE THE INSTANCE SIZE.

TERMINATION ALSO KNOWN AS SCALE-IN.

1.SQS ->WHAT IS VISIBILITY TIMEOUT FOR MESSAGE IN STANDRAD AND FIFO.

->SQS NEEDS SERVER TO COMMUNICATE WITH DATABASE IN BACKEND TO POLL THE QUEUE.THAT SERVER TIER IS CALLED WORKER TIER.
->IF WE WANT TO SEND MESSAGE TO MULTIPLE QUEUES THEN WE WILL USE SNS.(FANNING OUT)

2.SNS AND SWF(READ ABOUT MANUAL INTERVATION IN SWF).

3.SNOWBALL

LAB
------------
1.INTEGRATE SQS WITH SNS


**LAMBDA(FEATURES->WE CAN RUN MULTIPLE FUNCTION SIMULTANEOUSLY(CONCURRENCY))  
  ->USING STEP FUNCTION WE CAN START SEQUENCING LAMBDA

***LAMBDA@EDGE[SERVERLESS ARCITECTURE WITH LOW LATENCY](question will come)

**AMAZON COGNITO

**API & API GATEWAY(API CAN BE EDGE OPTIMISE(IMPORTANT))

-->ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE IS USE TO CONNECT TO DATABASE IN ELASTIC BEANSTALK WHERE DATABASE IS OUTSIDE.

**CACHING

-->WAF--->REVERSE PROXY->RECEIVING TRAFFIC FROM OUTSIDE THE WORLD(SERVICES SUPPORTS THIS PROXY ARE API GATEWAY,ELB,CLOUDFRONT)

-->ACCESS LOG IS SUPPORTED BY S3,EC2,CLOUD FRONT ,API GATEWAY.

-->FLOW LOGS

-->AD CONNECTOR
-->EMR
-->TRUSTED ADVISOR AND INSPECTOR
-->SHARED SECURITY MODEL
-->STORAGE GATEWAY(SNOWBALL)-->WE NEED STORAGE GATEWAY IF WE ARE DOING CONTINOUS BACKUP.
-->ECS
-->BACKUP NAME(NETBACKUP,NETWORKER,IBM TIVOLI->ALL ARE TAPE BACKUP)
-->RTO AND RPO(1 HR AND 15 MIN )[FROM DISASTER RECOVERY]
